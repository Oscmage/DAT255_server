# Testing

This document explains the testing for the server.

## Technical

For testing we're using 'assert' which comes built in with node, combined with 'chai' an external module([chai's webpage](http://chaijs.com/)). The request are done to localhost which means you will have to run the server locally(see descriptions below). 


## Running tests

To simply run the tests you will have to:
 
 1. Open the terminal and head to the "DAT_server" directory.
 
 2. Launch node locally by typing:.
 
 ```
 npm start
 ```
 
 3. Run the tests by typing:

 ```
 npm test
 ```
